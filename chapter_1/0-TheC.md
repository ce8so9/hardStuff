# The C

[Check out our free CTF Course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/page/view.php?id=377)

Welcome to the show.

Compile the code and make sure it runs.
<https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C/tree/master/Assignment-01>

I recommend you find yourself a copy of K&R C <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language> from somewhere, otherwise, there are plenty of good online resources. You might not need it for this module, but you will for some down the road.

Task: 

* Submit text discussing anything that you struggled with and didn't understand, and what you did to overcome that problem. If you still don't understand, tell us what specifically you did not understand.
