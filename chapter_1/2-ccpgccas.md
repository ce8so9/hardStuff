So you wrote it in C and it compiled.... but what is compilation? 

<http://cs-fundamentals.com/c-programming/how-to-compile-c-program-using-gcc.php>

1. Use `ccp` to convert your source code .c to a .i file.

2. Then use `gcc` to convert your .i file into a  .s  file. 

3. Then use `as` to convert your .s file into a .o binary.

What still needs to be done to get a .o binary to execute? 


Task: 

* Submit text discussing anything that you struggled with and didn't understand, and what you did to overcome that problem. If you still don't understand, tell us what specifically you did not understand.
