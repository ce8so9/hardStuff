Alright you wrote the C.
Welcome to Ghidra.

Here is a very very general tutorial. <https://github.com/hoppersroppers/nightmare/tree/master/modules/02-intro_tooling/ghidra>. Watch a few videos so you can open Ghidra up and mess around. I don't expect any of it to make sense, just play with it for a bit.

Task: 

* Submit text discussing anything that you struggled with and didn't understand, and what you did to overcome that problem. If you still don't understand, tell us what specifically you did not understand.
