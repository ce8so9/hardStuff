Welcome to GDB aka the GNU Debugger. 

Until the official Nightmare repo accepts my pull request, do this tutorial using the helloworld ELF you made. 

<https://github.com/hoppersroppers/nightmare/blob/master/modules/02-intro_tooling/gdb-gef/readme.md>

Once you have finished that tutorial with your ELF, do it again with the helloAviv ELF. There should be minor differences. 

Task: 

* Submit text discussing anything that you struggled with and didn't understand, and what you did to overcome that problem. If you still don't understand, tell us what specifically you did not understand.
