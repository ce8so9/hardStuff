# GDB

[Check out our free CTF Course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/page/view.php?id=995)

Compile your file using "gcc -g". Work through the file you created using GDB. While you are going through it, step  through using `nexti`. Then try to step through it using `next`. Set breakpoints and examine values and addresses as you see fit.

Recompile your file without using "-g" and work through it again. 

This is a journey of exploration, don't spend too much time, don't rush, just work through until you feel comfortable with what is going on with the values. 

1. Using what you have learned, describe what occurs in a technical manner, using addresses and values.
