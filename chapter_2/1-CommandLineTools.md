# Command Line Tools

[Check out our free course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/assign/view.php?id=993)

Using this program you just compiled, use some of your tools to learn more about it.

Run:

* `file`
* `strings` 
* `ltrace` 
*  `strace`
* `readelf`
* `ldd`



Don't really worry about understanding things. Just play with it for a few minutes

1. What does file tell us about this?
2. Are there any interesting strings? How many strings are there?
3. What are the function calls made?
4. What are the system calls made?
5. Is there anything else interesting you noticed? (Note: there doesn't need to be.)
