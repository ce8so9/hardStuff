# The C

[Check out our free CTF Course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/page/view.php?id=989)

We are doing "Hello World" again. All the modules going forward will generally match this module. There will not be any tutorials or things of that nature, the expectation is that anything you do not understand you will use one of the many C reference textbooks and Google to work through your problems. You can also always ask your questions in chat. 

Anytime that you get stuck, talk to a teacher so we can get you going in the right direction.

Compile the code and make sure it runs. Submit your C with comments.
